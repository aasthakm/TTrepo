Part 1:

How do we input the data from the user?

I have created few text files in input_data folder. User will update these files. Let's first decide on how are we storing these values in our codebase and implement functions to get these values from files and store in in a local data structure.

Function prototypes:
bool getTeachers(char ** teachers, char * errMsg);
bool getStandards(char ** standards, char * errMsg);
bool getSubjects(char ** subjects, char * errMsg);
bool getDays(char ** days, char * errMsg);
bool getPeriods(int * periods, char * errMsg);


# Enter list of teacher names along with their subject-standard requirements in this file
# Teacher should be first entered in teachers.txt
# Standards should be first entered in standards.txt
# Subjects should be first entered in subjects.txt
# Use following pattern:
# <teacher> <standard> <subject> <standard> <subject> ...

# Enter list of days in this file
# Use following day names only - "mon", "tue", "wed", "thu", "fri", "sat", "sun"
# Use only space or newline character to separate the names
# Don't use any delimiters like ',', '|', ';' etc.
